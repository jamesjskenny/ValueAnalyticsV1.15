# ValueAnalytics
Value Analytics is a CRM Analytics templated app that allows Business and IT to have a common view of adoption and how it relates to business metrics that matter.

## Templated App Considerations
This git repo is for developers who want to deploy and maintain their own instance of the Value Analytics template.
This requires extensive knowledge of [Analytics Template Development](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.bi_dev_guide_wave_templates.meta/bi_dev_guide_wave_templates/bi_templatesdev_intro_wave_templates.htm)
Developers should become familiar with the documentation before attempting to use this source repo.
As such, documentation for how to use the template and understand the dashboards within are contained in the [Value Analytics User Guide](https://salesforce.quip.com/61ASA8kRLHdn)
